These guidelines were written in the framework of the project on Statistical Methods and Tools for Time Series, Seasonal Adjustment and Statistical Disclo- sure Control (in short: STACE), co-financed by the European Union by means of grant agreement 899218 â€“ 219-BG-Methodology. Work package 2 of this project concerned a Center of Excellence on Statistical Disclosure Control (CoE on SDC) which was formed by the national statistical institutes (NISs) of The Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Iceland, Slovenia, Poland and Bulgaria. One of the goals of this CoE was to provide three guidelines for applying SDC. The CoE, together with Eurostat and the European Expert Group on Statistical Disclosure Control, decided on three topics for these guidelines: (1) Guidelines for SDC methods for Census and Demographics Data, (2) Guidelines for SDC Methods Applied on Geo-Referenced Data and (3) Update of the General SDC Handbook. 

The current document is the update of the General SDC Handbook. The old content is converted to markdown, updated, extended and now available as an online document as well as a pdf document.
